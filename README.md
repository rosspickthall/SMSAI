# SMSAI
This project is an SMS Alarm interface unit which began life on an arduino UNO and used a sim800 module. I've done some development work offline and have moved onto using the ATMega1284P chip and added GPRS services to enable prowl notifications. 
Prowl notifications and SMS alerts are working but APN info and Prowl API key are hard-coded into the code, i need to work on having these changeable by SMS and stored in the EEPROM.

I have a version of this running in my home and it works flawlessly and runs for months and months without resetting. 

I have uploaded some photos of some PCB boards I got made up for this to run on and a bit of an overview of the operation (although this was done before prowl functionality was added).
